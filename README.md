[ANU COMP1730/6730 S1 2020 - Project Assignment](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1730/assessment/project/) 

## Submission  

- The name of the file folder should contain one student name with ID#
- The file folder(in a zip file) should contain two files:
  - `assignment.py` , the Python script containing your implementation of the assignment;   
  - `answers.pdf` , a PDF version of your written report
    - university IDs and Names of all group members in front of the first page 
    - A simple assignment cover sheet is highly recommended.
  - (optionally) `assignment_tests.py` , which is a Python script containing any tests you have written to verify the correctness of your functions.(any testing functions you used to test your code).
  
## Attendion  

- pay attention to the section Requirements,Expectations, and Marking Criteria in the original `assignment specification document` as well as the `Marking`. 

## Marking  

- **Problem Generalisation (5%)**  
  - All aspects of the solution would work on any data set in the same format containing any reasonable data values.  
- **Data Structure (10%)**  
  - Chosen data structure well suited to subsequent usage, leading to efficient code in terms of both programmer and computer time.
- **Code Quality (15%)**
  - Excellent documentation
  - naming and style 
  - following Python conventions 
  - making the code easy to read
- **Organisation (10%)**
  - Code very well organised, using sub-functions as appropriate.
  - All functions are modular.
  - The overall program structure makes the code easy to follow.
- **Report (10%)**
  - Report is well organised, well presented, clear and concise.
  - Excellent choice of examples and good discussion.
- **Testing and correctness**  
  - common request:
    - Results are correct for all use cases, including edge- cases. 
    - Clear evidence of testing to verify correctness.
  - separate request(marks included in testing):
    - Q1(10%)
      - Significant attempt made at handling missing values and validating data.
    - Q2(10%)
    - Q3(10%)
      - Excellent choice of chart and formatting options,
      - clearly conveying the required information and relationships.
      - Chart formatting all done within Python.
    - Q4(10%) and Q5(10%)  “correct” varies based on chosen approach
      - Novel, elegant or otherwise exceptional approach taken.
